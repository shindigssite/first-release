  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p>Shin-Digs was conceived by its founder, Andrew Jones, in the Summer of 2012. Andrew noticed that his hometown of Tampa had a lot of cool events (or shindigs) but had no way of visiting a single site to discover what these events were. After spending weeks performing development and initial data entry, Andrew had created a repository of events that could be enjoyed by people of many varying tastes.</p>

  <p>Over the next several months, you can expect to see many more events added to the list. In addition, features such as photo sharing, RSVP, and event reviews/comments will be rolled out. Keep checking back to see what's new!</p>
